<p class="c"><i>This edition is limited to<br />
250 copies, of which this<br />

<p><i>It is many a year since a book has attained the popularity
of Mr. du Maurier's second novel, "Trilby" (printed
as a serial in Harper's Monthly, from January to August,
inclusive, and then issued in book-form, on Saturday, 8 September,
1894). Several others have sold as well&mdash;some even
better; but neither "Looking Backward" nor "Ben Hur"
(to name but these two) has captivated the public in the same
manner or in the same degree as this romance, this fairy-tale
of the three British artists, the blanchisseuse who posed for
"the altogether," the Parisian masters of painting, and the
trans-Rhenish masters of music, in the Latin Quarter of the
early fifties. It is a story written out of the author's very
heart, and it finds its way straight to the hearts of his readers.
This is the secret of its unique success. Its charm is
emotional rather than intellectual. With all its art, it impresses
one as essentially ingenuous. It is a book to be loved,
not merely to be liked or admired.</i></p>

<p><i>On 16 June, 1894, The Critic printed, with comment, a
letter in which Mr. Whistler protested to the editor of an English
newspaper against the libellous likeness of himself to be
found in the character of Joe Sibley, one of the minor personages
in the story of "Trilby." In the fall there were so many
sporadic calls for this number of the paper as soon to exhaust
the supply carried over from the summer. There seemed
to be a general desire on the part of our readers to bind
up the Whistler letters, etc., with the text and pictures of
"Trilby" as printed in Harper's Monthly, the American artist's
protest having led to a slight revision of the story before its
appearance in book-form. The hint was acted upon; and two
pages of "Trilbyana" were printed in The Critic of Nov. 17.</i></p>

<p><i>Though an extra edition was struck off, the call for this
number has at last exhausted the supply; and the present
pamphlet, containing among its many items of interest a majority
of those that have found a place in the columns of The Critic,
may fairly claim to be issued in response to a popular call.</i></p>

<h3>"Trilby: a Novel"</h3>

<p class="c"><i>By George du Maurier. With Illustrations by the Author. Harper &amp;
Brothers.</i></p>

<p>When "<span class="smcap">Trilby</span>" began to appear as a serial in <i>Harper's
Monthly</i>, January 1894, Mr. Henry James prophesied that
it would prove to be a glorification of "the long leg and the
twentieth year." The prophecy was soon verified. At the
outset, indeed, it seemed as if the glorification were to be,
not so much of the long leg, as of the large and shapely foot.
The whole story rested for a while on one of Trilby's feet.
We say one, for it was only one of them&mdash;the left one&mdash;that
Little Billee immortalized by drawing on the wall of the
studio in the Place St. Anatole des Arts; but they were
equally perfect. As the young woman who had the happiness
of standing on this foot proclaims, kicking off one of
the big slippers in which she is introduced to us, "It's the
handsomest foot in all Paris: there's only one in all Paris to
match it, and here it is"&mdash;and off goes the other slipper.
The sketch of it that proves Little Billee already a master of
his art is not shown till near the end of the book; and neither
this nor Mr. du Maurier's own portrait of the <i>pieds nus</i> on
page 21 fully realizes one's notion of the thing's unapproached
perfection.</p>

<p>As we have said, the whole story rests for a while on one
of these handsome feet; but the novelist manages at last to
free his neck from the thraldom of the "slim, straight, rosy
heel, clean-cut and smooth as the back of a razor," and proceeds
to gratify our curiosity to know something about the
strange being who poked about the studios in the Quartier
Latin in the early fifties, bare-headed, and wearing a big,
military coat with epaulets, which she could throw off when
she posed for the <i>ensemble</i> as easily as she could kick off the
loose slippers when only her foot was desired as a model. It
will be seen that Trilby was not a woman of any social
standing. Her father was an educated Irishman, her mother
(his wife) a pretty barmaid. They both were dead, and she
herself was a professional model.</p>

<p>Two things about her were equally marvellous: one was her
foot, the other her voice&mdash;an organ of surprising power, range
and sweetness. No less extraordinary, perhaps, was the trick
that nature had played upon her, by coupling so glorious a
voice with an ear that could not distinguish one note from<a name="page_002" id="page_002"></a>
another&mdash;could scarcely tell a bass from a treble, and permitted
her to sing so badly that her hearers either stopped
their ears, laughed in her face, or bolted from the room. The
American song "Ben Bolt" was the one she liked the best to
sing, and sang the worst. There was something else about
her, almost as strange as her beautiful feet, her magnificent
voice and her defective (or altogether lacking) ear for music;
and that was the purity of her character. She had had affairs
with half a dozen men in the studios, without really knowing
that it wasn't the right thing to do. But her heart remained
spotless (so Mr. du Maurier assures us); and it is a most unfortunate
thing that Little Billee's mother comes tearing over
to Paris, leaving the peaceful dales and dairies of Devonshire
behind her, in her mad haste to break the engagement which
Trilby has at last made with the young English painter, after
having repeatedly refused to do so, notwithstanding her great
love for him. Mrs. Bagot has no difficulty in convincing her
that she is no worthy mate for Little Billee; and she accordingly
runs away from Paris, heart-broken, and becomes a
<i>blanchisseuse de fin</i>. Little Billee's heart is broken, too; or
if not broken, benumbed; and henceforth, though he becomes
a most successful artist, and the pet of all London, he
takes his pleasures and successes sadly and listlessly, caring
nothing for the wealth and fame that come to him.</p>

<p>In the meantime a great <i>prima-donna</i> appears upon the
European stage, and all the world bows down before her.
Happening to be in Paris, Little Billee is persuaded by
his old chums, Taffy the Yorkshireman ex-soldier, and the
"Laird of Cockpen"&mdash;painters both,&mdash;to go and hear the
prodigy. Fancy their stupefaction at recognizing in the
glorious singer the tuneless Trilby of five years gone! No
longer Trilby O'Ferrall, but La Svengali, wife of their old
acquaintance Svengali the Jew, who had recognized the
possibilities of her voice when he first heard it in their Paris
studio, and had afterwards captured her and cultivated it
and by his mesmeric arts trained her as a singer and even
made her love him as a dog loves his master. A day or two
later, meeting him at a hotel, Svengali spits in Little Billee's
face, and gets his nose pulled for his pains by Taffy. And
then the great <i>prima-donna</i> and her master go to London;
and Trilby breaks down in trying to sing "Ben Bolt," and is
hooted off the stage&mdash;Svengali's sudden death in a stage-box
(unknown to anyone in the house) having broken the mesmeric
influence that has made her a singer. She pines
away, surrounded by her old friends the Englishmen, and
an object of solicitude to all Christendom; and after her<a name="page_003" id="page_003"></a>
death Little Billee pines away, too, and no one is left but
the big ex-officer Taffy&mdash;with the exception of Trilby, the
most attractive character in the book. For Little Billee
(whose sister he marries, after the death of Trilby, whom he,
too, loved) is, truth to tell, somewhat of a prig, even after the
sight of Trilby at the concert in Paris has roused him from
the unemotional state to which her flight consigned him, years
before; and Svengali is a beast, and Gecko is insignificant.</p>

<p>The text of the book is the counterpart of its illustrations,
for Mr. du Maurier writes as he draws&mdash;with infinite precision
and detail. Nothing is omitted that could possibly
heighten an effect. Instead of flashing a scene or a sensation
upon you, he describes it and redescribes it, heaping
up the adjectives in masses. His art is a different art from
Kipling's, for instance, which never wastes a syllable. But
the point to be decided is not one of methods but of results;
and as a whole "Trilby" is delightful. It is a slow and
laborious process by which the author creates an impression
and surrounds his characters with the atmosphere he wishes
us to see them in; but he does finally create the impression
and the atmosphere, and in so doing justifies his means. He
has steeped his mind in Thackeray, and so has had a noble
master. Like "Peter Ibbetson," his new story is unique.
It is a book that could have been written only by an artist&mdash;and
illustrated only by the author; it is a book, moreover, in
which the man and the style are one.</p>

<p>In its present form the story contains certain passages not
printed in the magazine&mdash;notably, a brief disquisition on
sitting for the nude. On the other hand, certain passages
have been altered in deference to the wishes of Mr. Whistler,
who saw in Joe Sibley, as described and pictured by Mr. du
Maurier, an unpleasant resemblance to himself. Not only
has the text been altered, but our friend Sibley is now called
Antony, and his hitherto unbearded face is adorned with a
non-Whistlerian beard. (See "Trilby," opposite page 132.)
One picture has been omitted altogether. It needed not the
accidental advertising of Mr. Whistler's threatened libel suit
to draw attention to the book. It is its own best advertisement,
and has fairly earned the success implied in advance
orders so numerous as to cause the postponement until to-day
(8 Sept. 1894) of the original date of publication.<a name="page_004" id="page_004"></a></p>

<h3>Mr. du Maurier as a Draughtsman</h3>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that Mr. du Maurier's work
as a novelist is in no way matched by his work as a draughtsman,
as exemplified, for instance, in the 120 drawings for
"Trilby," exhibited in December, 1894, at the Avery gallery.
Until he began to write he was known merely as the author
of innumerable caricatures, which had a certain vogue because
they were at the same time pictures of fashionable
society; but even of these the legend was often the best
part. He had mastered many types, but they were nothing
more than that; and one had seen his millionaires and
swells and singing people and artists until one had grown
rather tired of them. Then, suddenly, it was found, with the
first chapters of his first novel, that in writing he could give
to all these well-known figures individuality, could make
flesh and blood of them. The drawings themselves, at least
those done as illustrations for his two romances, seem to
have gained by that discovery. These do not appear to be
the same French blouses and English guardsmen. Something
has got into them, a touch of life, which they did not
have before. Yet no one will say that the Little Billee of the
drawings now exhibited at Avery's gallery is even a shadow of
the Little Billee of the text. Of Trilby there is not so much
as the famous foot. Any schoolboy, almost, might have
made as clever a travesty of the Venus de Milo. The best
presentment of the gigantic Taffy is that in which he poses as
the Ilyssus. The Laird o' Cockpen is much better, being
frequently very like Mr. George W. Cable, particularly where
he listens to Trilby's confession&mdash;an accidental likeness, no
doubt, but one that increases our respect for the Laird. The
intentional likeness of Frederick Walker, who is said to be
the real original of Little Billee, is vastly superior to the
ideal one; and the many unnamed figures in the more crowded
compositions that appear to have been sketched from the life
or from a particularly vivid memory are among the most
amusing and enjoyable things in the drawings.</p>

<p>But it must not be denied that there is here and there a
bit of <i>chic</i> that approaches the ideal&mdash;something not easily
to be discovered in the artist's former work. Svengali is
throughout a creation of this sort. He is as grotesquely romantic,
as Mephistophelian a figure in the illustration as in
the printed page. The only failure is the head (on page 59<a name="page_005" id="page_005"></a>
of the book) which is in more senses than one "as bad as
they make them." He is excellent where he laughs over the
two Englishmen cleaning themselves; he is delightful where
he examines the roof of Trilby's mouth, "like the dome of
the Panthéon," "room in it for 'toutes les gloires de la
France.'" Where he stands in the midst of the crowded studio,
"All as it Used to Be," he looks every inch the artist,
more so than the "idle apprentice," lounging against the
door-jamb. If there were such a man, one who had sunk his
whole soul in his art, he might look like this, or like the same
figure in the hussar uniform, a Semitic conqueror "out of
the mysterious East." There is a touch of the spirit of the
illustrators of the romantic period in the pictures of the
Christmas festivities, especially in the two that illustrate the
peculiar interchange of rôles between Little Billee and the
festive Ribot, and in the sketch of Zouzou as the "Ducal
French Fighting-Cock." The scenes of common life, too,
are admirable, the free-and-easy, the "Happy Dinner," the
bargaining of the Laird with Mme. Vinard&mdash;"Je prong!"&mdash;and
the scene at the rehearsal where "The First Violin
Loses his Temper." The art of the drawings is all in expression
and action, and Du Maurier, in spite of all that is
French in him, is thoroughly British in this, and a descendant
in the right line of Hogarth, Cruikshank and Leech.</p>

<p>The "Trilby" drawings were bought <i>en bloc</i> by some one
in England. They had been sent here to be engraved for
<i>Harper's Monthly</i> and the book; the sale occurred before
they were placed on exhibition in New York. A representative
of <i>The Critic</i> asked Mr. Avery, who said that a number of
people had expressed a desire to buy some of them, what he
thought they would have brought, if sold over here. He replied
that he could not tell with any degree of accuracy, but he
thought they would have averaged at least $50 apiece. As there
are 120 drawings, this would have meant $6,000 more for Mr.
du Maurier. <i>En bloc</i>, no doubt, they brought a smaller sum.</p>

<p>A painting of "Trilby," by Mr. Constant Mayer, was
shown at Knoedler's gallery, in December, along with half a
dozen other and more satisfactory paintings by the same
artist. The hypnotic condition of the subject was declared
by Dr. Allan McLane Hamilton to be admirably suggested
in this fancy portrait.</p>

<p class="asterisks">* * *</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">To the Editors of The Critic</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>Those who express surprise at the sudden literary development
of du Maurier's genius do not apparently recognize
the fact that the whole series of his drawings has included<a name="page_006" id="page_006"></a>
the literary element. His thoughts as expressed in art have
always shown a close and philosophical observation of life,
an understanding of the actions and motives of men. Every
one of his illustrations tells not only an individual story, but
a story of surroundings and times, of tendencies, fads and
foibles. And the text is always as important as the picture;
sometimes it is far more so. Who can have forgotten the
history and culmination of the "old china" craze given by
du Maurier in a four-inch-square illustration of the young
husband and wife examining an old teapot, with the exquisite
text, "Oh, Algernon, do you think we can ever live up to
it?" Certainly the man who could invent the application
of that phrase must have stores of wit and sense equal to
the writing of many "Peter Ibbetsons" and "Trilbys." And
those stores were bound to find their larger expression in
literature.</p>

<p class="asterisks">* * *</p>

<p>The New York <i>Tribune</i> has printed the following protest
against the insinuation that the author of the book was not
its illustrator also:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It ought not to be necessary for any formal contradiction to
be made of that absurd rumor which has just been set adrift concerning
the illustrations to 'Trilby.' On the face of it, it is impossible
for either Mrs. du Maurier or her daughter to have given the
pictures the character they possess. They have du Maurier's style,
du Maurier's technique, du Maurier's peculiar little touches of
humor, not merely in the broad idea but in that minute turn of the
pen which makes all the difference in the world between an empty
profile and a funny one. It is true that there is a dissimilarity between
Trilby in one illustration and Trilby in another, but it should
be remembered that du Maurier's eyesight has been failing him,
that he has been compelled to be prolific at a time when he has
most needed to lie fallow as an artist; and, in brief, the shortcomings
of the 'Trilby' designs, if serious shortcomings they have,
are to be explained on the most natural and logical of grounds.
The intrinsic character of the drawings proclaims their authorship.
Only George du Maurier could have done them, and not any of the
trifling assistance which he may have received from his family in
matters of posing, costume, etc., could deprive him of his responsibility
or his honor. The recent tendency to criticise these designs
with some severity will soon be counteracted. As a matter
of fact, they present some of the cleverest work du Maurier has
ever done."</p>

<p class="asterisks">* * *</p>

<p>The New York <i>Sun</i> printed a letter, not long ago, in which
the drawings were declared to be anachronistic. "Why," it
was asked, "should Mr. du Maurier deny to his characters<a name="page_007" id="page_007"></a>
the crinolines, waterfalls, surtouts, cravats, chignons, peg-top
trousers and hoop-skirts of the early sixties, and make them,
despite Taffy's whiskers, of the <i>monde</i> of to-day? Is it that
his artistic instincts have reverted to that fine school of old
masters who delighted to portray, saving Taffy's grace, Hector
fighting in the armor of the Black Prince, or turned out Madonnas
by the score in Margaret of Anjou skirts?"</p>

<p class="asterisks">* * *</p>

<p>In "Trilby" every stroke of pen or pencil seems to be
significant. Is there special meaning in the fact that, in
the dainty tail-piece, one glass in the spectacles appears
to be heavily shaded, while the other is clear? Is Mr.
du Maurier, like so many literary people, afflicted with
partial loss of sight or other visual difficulty?</p>

<h3>"Trilby" on the Stage</h3>

<p>Mr. Paul M. Potter's dramatization of "Trilby" was produced
by Mr. A. M. Palmer's company at the Boston Museum
on Monday, 4 March, 1895, and achieved so great a success
that several companies were immediately put upon the road
to play it throughout the country. Its first production in
New York, with the original cast, occurred at the Garden
Theatre, on April 15. Hundreds of people were turned away
from the door for want of room to accommodate them; and
an offer was received from Mr. Beerbohm Tree, the eminent
English actor, for the privilege of producing the play in
England, where he himself wished to impersonate Svengali.
It would be a pity if the Lyceum company did not secure the
English rights; for Mr. Irving would make an inimitable
Svengali, and Ellen Terry would be Trilby without trying.</p>

<p>As nobody has ever succeeded, or is likely to succeed, in
really dramatizing a novel, it is not surprising that the stage
version of "Trilby" should prove in some respects unsatisfactory.
It might be thought that the book would lend itself
readily to dramatic treatment; but a little consideration will
show that it offers peculiar difficulties to the playwright, inasmuch
as its chief charm is one of manner, which cannot be
transferred to the stage, while its story, although it contains
some striking situations, such as Trilby's collapse upon the
death of Svengali, consists chiefly of a series of episodes,
largely independent of each other and strung together very
loosely. All things considered, Mr. Potter ought not, perhaps,
to be held to too strict an account for the liberties he has
taken with the text and some of the personages, but he has
certainly lowered the tone of the work, and been guilty of
various crudities of construction. There is some excuse for
his employment of Svengali as the evil influence which wrecks
the happiness of Little Billee and Trilby, but he leaves nothing
of the author's original intention, and infinitely belittles
the character of the girl, when he attributes her flight from her
lover to mesmeric suggestion, instead of her own noble and
unselfish devotion. In many other similar ways the spiritual
side of the book suffers at his hands. His persistent references
to Trilby's posing for the figure, his selection of that
particular incident for her first introduction, and the joking
references to it which he puts into the mouths of other personages,
are in bad taste, while his travesty of the character<a name="page_009" id="page_009"></a>
of Dr. Bagot is entirely without justification. Mrs. Bagot he
treats with more consideration, but he reduces her to the level
of the dullest stage conventionality. Trilby herself preserves a
good many of her characteristics, but is degraded even more
than in the book by her subserviency to Svengali.</p>

<p>The play is in four acts, and the whole story up to the flight
of Trilby is compressed into the first two. This feat is accomplished
with no small ingenuity, but at great cost of probability.
In this brief space Trilby is wooed and won, Svengali
asserts his mesmeric power, the marriage of Little Billee
is arranged and interrupted by the arrival of his mother, and
an elopement is planned and frustrated. In the third act
Trilby is to sing in the Cirque des Bashibazouck, and all the
characters reassemble as if by magic in the foyer of that temple
of art, which is abandoned of all other persons for their
sole benefit. The proceedings which are supposed to occur
in this retired spot are intrinsically absurd, but they are effective
enough from a scenic and theatrical point of view, and
were accepted by the audience, on the first night, as eminently
natural and satisfactory. They culminate in the ghastly death
of Svengali and the restoration of Trilby in a dazed and exhausted
condition to the three faithful friends. In the fourth
act there is another reunion of characters, and Trilby, who
has agreed once more to marry Little Billee, and is supposed
to be on the road to recovery, dies suddenly, upon the unexpected
apparition of Svengali's photograph.</p>

<p>As it stands, the play is not much superior, if at all, to
ordinary melodrama, being almost wholly void of the literary,
humorous and personal charm of the book, but it is very
well played, has a number of effective scenes, and is unquestionably
popular. Miss Harned's Trilby, though rather a faint
reflection of the original, has the merit of being attractive
and womanly, as well as free and frank, and exhibits true
pathos in the mesmeric scenes. On the whole, it is a very
creditable impersonation. Mr. Lackaye's Svengali is overwrought
but indisputably strong; and Burr McIntosh, John
Glendenning and Alfred Hickman represent the three friends
cleverly, and furnish excellent living pictures of du Maurier's
sketches. Mr. Dietrichstein makes an admirable Zouzou,
and all the minor parts are performed competently. A feature
of the representation which is received with special
favor is the Christmas merrymaking in the Latin Quarter,
which is as vivacious and realistic as could be wished.</p>

<p>A matter of considerable interest to authors and publishers,
for the copyright question involved, occurred in connection
with the Boston performances. Elmer Chickering,<a name="page_010" id="page_010"></a>
the well-known photographer of Boston, took some pictures
of Mr. A. M. Palmer's company, which naturally came into
demand at once. But rushing over the wires came a message
from Harper &amp; Bros., saying that, as the characters were
made up after du Maurier's drawings, they should regard
the sale of any such pictures as an infringement of their copyright.
To this, Mr. Chickering disagreed, on the ground
that the photographs were not copies of any drawings, but
of actual scenes on the stage, which any man might sketch.
Telegrams flew back and forth, for the Messrs. Harper
would not yield. Meanwhile, the papers sought for the
photographs, and Mr. Palmer was apparently willing to receive
the advertisement their publication would ensure; but
the publishers still held off. At last Mr. Chickering decided
to fight it out on his own line, for two of the New York papers
printed some of the 160 "Trilby" pictures taken by him;
and&mdash;as indicating an amicable adjustment of the dispute&mdash;a
number of them appeared in <i>Harper's Weekly</i>.</p>

<p>The morning papers of April 30 contained this despatch:&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Denver,
Col.</span>, April 29. Did du Maurier write 'Trilby'?
This novel question was propounded to-day in the United States
Court in good faith, when the suit of Harper &amp; Bros. and A. M.
Palmer for an injunction against the Lyceum Stock Company to
restrain them from producing 'Trilby' at their theatre was called.
The defendants allege that the book entitled 'Trilby' was not
originated, invented or written by du Maurier. They assert that
the original title and book of 'Trilby' were first published in
France in 1820, and afterwards translated and published in English
in 1847, and that the title and book have been common property
for seventy-five years. The attorneys for the plaintiffs asked
for time to communicate with their clients in New York as to the
course they should pursue, and the Court postponed the hearing
until Wednesday morning. Should the allegations of the Lyceum
Company be true, a sensation will be caused all over the two continents.
This is the first public intimation of an attack on the
authenticity of the work, and if it is successful every company in
the world will have as much right to play 'Trilby' as the Boston
Organization."</p>

<p>The Lounger reprinted the telegram with this comment:&mdash;"Charles
Nodier's 'Trilby, le Lutin d'Argail,' was published
in Paris in 1822. It has just one thing in common with du
Maurier's book&mdash;the first word in its title." The Sunday
papers of May 12 printed this paragraph:&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Denver</span>, May
11. Judge Hallet, in the United States District Court to-day,
granted an injunction restraining the Lyceum Theatre
from producing 'Trilby' hereafter, deciding that it infringed
on the rights of Harper &amp; Bros., and others. To-day's performance
was stopped."</p>

<h3>Personalia</h3>

<p>A London correspondent of the Philadelphia <i>Press</i> furnishes
some interesting notes of a talk with Mr. du Maurier.
Concerning literary practice, the artist-novelist said that
"Peter Ibbetson" was
absolutely the first
story he ever wrote.
"And yet," he added,
"I have in one sense
been writing stories all
my life. Every one of
my pictures, for example,
has had under
it a story condensed to
the smallest possible
space. The necessity
of condensing my description
and dialogue
has been of great benefit
to me in writing my
two novels." As for
"Trilby," Mr. du Maurier
said that his earliest
conception of the
story was quite different
from the one he
finally worked out. "I
had first thought of
Trilby as a girl of very
low birth&mdash;a servant, or something like that. Then it occurred
to me that it would be much better to make her
interesting&mdash;to create a person who would be liked by readers.
As a good many people seem to be fond of 'Trilby'
now, I am very glad, indeed, that I made the change." And
he declared further that the character of Trilby was not a
study from life, but wholly imaginary. It was Henry James
who suggested to the artist that he should write novels.</p>

<p>"It was one day while we were walking together on
Hampstead Heath. We were talking about storywriting, and
I said to him:&mdash;'If I were a writer, it seems to me that I
should have no difficulty about plots. I have in my head
now plots for fifty stories. I'm always working them out for
my own amusement.' 'Well,' he said, 'it seems to me that<a name="page_012" id="page_012"></a>
you are a very fortunate person; I wish you'd tell me one of
those plots.' Then I told him the story of 'Trilby.'" "Yes,
he praised it very generously. 'Well,' I said, 'you may have
the idea and work it out to your own satisfaction.' But he refused
to accept it. 'You must write it yourself,' he said: 'I'm
sure you can do it, if you'll only try.' But I insisted that I
couldn't, and so we left the matter. But that night after going
home it occurred to me that it would be worth while
trying to write, after all. So on the impulse I sat down and
began to work. It was not on 'Trilby,' however, but on
'Peter Ibbetson.' I kept at it for a time, but after doing
several chapters I became utterly discouraged, and said to
myself one evening:&mdash;'Oh, I can't do anything with this.
It's a mad story. It's utter rubbish.' Then I took up the
sheets and was just about to throw them into the fire when
I thought I'd keep them for another day and think the thing
over. That night in bed, while I was worrying about the
impossibility of going on with the tale, the solution of my
difficulty suddenly occurred to me. 'I'll make the hero mad,'
I cried to myself, 'that will put everything right.' So the
next day I wrote the introduction, explaining Peter's madness,
and after that I went on with the work to the end without
any more trouble."</p>

<p>"Trilby's" American publishers have sent out the following
note:&mdash;"A letter from Mr. du Maurier to the late James
R. Osgood is given herewith. Possibly the hint it contains
as to the secret of an exquisite literary style will interest the
greater number of readers; or perhaps his saying (in 1890)
that he has 'several good ideas,' which would seem to be an
answer to those who have maintained that 'Trilby' was
written many years ago.<span class="spc"> &nbsp; * * *</span></p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">My Dear Osgood</span>:&mdash;Of course I remembered my promise,
and as soon as my book&mdash;"Peter Ibbetson"&mdash;was finished and
typewritten, I wrote to you&mdash;last week, as it happens&mdash;at 50
Fleet Street, but behold! you were in America; so I sent them
the copy, and I believe it starts by to-day's mail for Harper in
New York. I don't know how it got into the papers that I was
coming out in this new line, but I have already offers to come to
an arrangement. I have no notion whether it is suited to a periodical
or not&mdash;you will see; probably <i>not</i>,&mdash;but if it is I want to
be well paid for it; first [illegible], as far as my <i>first</i> book is concerned,
whatever its merits; secondly, because the only people to
whom I have told the story (H. James, Canon Ainger, poor Allingham
and a few others) thought so well of it&mdash;or said so&mdash;as an
<i>idea</i>; and I have taken great pains in the carrying out thereof.
If Harper's doesn't see its way to it, I shall offer it elsewhere;
and after that, I shall put it in the hands of an agent. And if I
don't get what I think I ought to, I shall keep it and write another,<a name="page_013" id="page_013"></a>
as I have several good ideas, and writing this has taught me a lot.
All of which sounds very cheeky and grand; but I am in no hurry
to come before the public as a novelist before I'm ripe, and to
ripen myself duly I am actually rewriting it in French, and you've
no idea what a lesson <i>that</i> is!<span class="spc"> &nbsp; * * *</span></p>

<p class="r">'Yours ever, <span class="smcap">G. du Maurier</span>.</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">15 Bayswater Terrace, London</span>, April 18, 1890.'"</p>

<p>It is said that when the Messrs. Harper were negotiating
with Mr. du Maurier for "Trilby," he declined their offer of
a royalty on the sales of the book and decided in favor of a
"lump sum." We do not know how large this sum was, but
we are pretty sure that it was not so much as he would have
made by the royalty plan. That would have earned at least
$30,000 for him on a sale of about 100,000 copies to 31 Dec.,
1894. The Messrs. Harper have, however, done a more
than generous thing by him: they have informed him that
they will pay him a royalty, and a good big one, too, on all
sales after 1 Jan., 1895, on both "Trilby" and "Peter Ibbetson."
The 600 copies of the <i>édition de luxe</i> of "Trilby,"
at $10 a copy, were sold outright to the Syndicate Trading Co.</p>

<p>Our London correspondent, Mr. Arthur Waugh, wrote to
us on 16 April, 1895:&mdash;"The English reading public is to
have its illustrated 'Trilby' in one volume in June. Hitherto
the three-volume edition has alone been in circulation, and
that without the illustrations. There are to be no sketches
in all, and arrangements are also in progress for a large-paper
edition of 250 copies, with six facsimile reproductions of
original drawings, unbound." Advance orders were received
for 15,000 copies of the six-shilling edition.</p>

<p>In an interview reported in the <i>Tribune</i> of June 14, Mr. J.
Henry Harper was quoted as saying, apropos of a cablegram
to the effect that the writing of "The Martians" was completed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He assures me that his new story will not be ready for the
publishers until December, 1896. I cannot tell you much about
the book itself yet, but it will not be in any sense a sequel to
'Trilby' except so far as it will succeed that book. The new story
will deal in its opening chapters with French school life, and then
with English life, both fashionable and rowdy; then the artistic
world of Antwerp and Dusseldorf is exploited, while the closing
stages occur in England. There will be love in the tale, of course,
and du Maurier also brings in the supernatural again. There will
be plenty of liveliness and some tragedy. The book, I am given
to understand, will be capable of illustration; but I am sorry to
say there is some doubt as to whether du Maurier himself will illustrate
it. It will depend entirely upon the state of his health,
which of late has not been of the best. The length of the story
will be greater than 'Trilby' and will run through about twelve<a name="page_014" id="page_014"></a>
numbers of <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, in which it will first be published
in serial form."</p>

<p>As a matter of course, Mr. du Maurier has had no end
of invitations to read and lecture in this country, but to all
these invitations he has turned a deaf ear. In a recent
letter to <i>The Critic's</i> Lounger, he expressed himself as flattered
by these overtures, but added that his health would not
permit of his accepting any of the tempting propositions.
He might be more in the way of temptation, if it were not
for the play of "Trilby." This brings him in almost as much
money as readings would. We are told that he is in receipt
of several hundred dollars a week from this source&mdash;not ten
hundred, but very near it. This, surely, is a much easier way
of earning money than travelling from one end of a big
country to the other, for it costs him no greater exertion
than the signing of his name to a check.</p>

<p>No one who loves "Trilby" should fail to read the "autobiographic
interview" with du Maurier which Mr. Robert
H. Sherard contributed, with illustrations, to <i>McClure's
Magazine</i> for April, 1895. From this singularly intimate and
interesting article, one learns that the author's first picture in
<i>Punch</i> represented himself and his chum Whistler<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>; also, that
the studio in the Latin Quarter where Trilby visited the
three English artists was drawn from that of his master,
Gleyre.</p>

<p>Mr. du Maurier's monogram, which appears on the title-page
of this pamphlet, is reproduced from a carving on the table at
which the staff contributors to <i>Punch</i> dine once a week, and
on which many of them have made similar inscriptions. We
are indebted for it to <i>McClure's Magazine</i>.</p>

<h3>Mr. du Maurier and Mr. Whistler</h3>

<p>The first two or three of the following paragraphs appeared
on the Lounger's page in <i>The Critic</i> of 16 June,
1894, and were reprinted, with most of the Whistler-du Maurier
items that succeed them, in the issue of Nov. 17.</p>

<p class="whistler">(From The Westminster Budget)<br />
Mr. Whistler</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Whistler has mastered two arts besides painting and
sketching. One he has immortalized in that unique brochure,
"The Gentle Art of Making Enemies"; the other is the Gentle
Art of Advertising
Oneself.
These two generalities
are not
always to be distinguished
from
each other. It
is quite possible
to make an enemy
in advertising
oneself; and nothing
is easier than
to draw general
attention to oneself,
by the same
act that incurs
the enmity of
individual&mdash;especially
if the
individual be
eminent. At the
present moment
M. du Maurier
happens to be
one of the most
conspicuous figures in the field jointly occupied by Art and
Letters. In choosing him as an object of clamorous attack,
Mr. Whistler has shown himself a past-master of the art of
advertising oneself. By identifying himself with one of the
characters in a story that everyone is reading, he brings himself
more conspicuously before the public than by painting a
new picture. Moreover, in sending to an English newspaper
a letter in which he vituperates his quondam friend and fellow-artist,
he interrupts himself for but a moment in the
pursuit of his legitimate calling as a painter.<a name="page_016" id="page_016"></a></p>

<p>In America, at least, few readers of "Trilby" would have
known that, in Joe Sibley, Mr. du Maurier had hit off some
of the most salient "peculiarities" of the immensely talented
etcher, who, when he takes the newspapers into his confidence,
dips his pen in the corrosive acid with which he bites
his plates. Joe Sibley is not an engaging character; he is
a Bohemian of the Bohemians, clever, witty, penniless and
presuming. In taking his sibilant surname as a pseudonym
for Whistler, we have the endorsement of the artist himself,
though he does not expressly declare himself to be the archetype
of this particular character. Sibley is the only man in
the book who <i>could</i> have been drawn from Whistler&mdash;the
Whistler of a generation ago; and no one but Sibley could
have written the following letter, in which the creator of the
character is so wittily vilified:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">To the Editor&mdash;SIR</span>: It would seem, notwithstanding;
my boastful declaration, that, after all, I had not, before leaving
England, completely rid myself of the abomination&mdash;the 'friend '!
One solitary, unheeded one&mdash;Mr. George du Maurier&mdash;still remained,
hidden in Hampstead. On that healthy heath he has been
harboring, for nearly half a life, every villainy of good fellowship
that could be perfected by the careless frequentation of our early
intimacy and my unsuspecting <i>camaraderie</i>. Of this pent-up envy,
malice and furtive intent he never at any moment during all that
time allowed me, while affectionately grasping his honest Anglo-French
fist, to detect the faintest indication. Now that my back
is turned, the old <i>marmite</i> of our <i>pot-au-feu</i> he fills with the picric
acid of 30 years' spite, and, in an American magazine, fires off
his bomb of mendacious recollection and poisoned rancour. The
lie with which it is loaded <i>à mon intention</i> he proposes for my possible
'future biographer'&mdash;but I fancy it explodes, as is usual, in
his own waistcoat, and he furnishes, in his present unseemly state,
an excellent example of all those others who, like himself, have
thought a foul friend a finer fellow than an open enemy.</p>

<p class="asterisks">* * *</p>

<p>One of the humors of the controversy was a letter that appeared
in the first number of Harry Furniss's <i>Lika-Joko</i>.
It was supposed to have been written by Whistler to express
his indignation at having been cut out of the book. The
English as well as the American papers fell into the trap, and
discussed the letter as a genuine expression of Mr. Whistler's
outraged feelings. It was only a joke, however&mdash;and is said
to have been the only joke in Mr. Furniss's comic paper.
To an interviewer for <i>The Westminster Budget</i>, Mr. Whistler
expressed his surprise that anyone should have been taken
in by the parody. "There was no harm in the appearance
of the article," he said, "but what caused my merriment,
though not surprise, is that anyone would have thought for
a moment that I had written it. But then, it was in England,
and in England anything is possible!" That the parody
was a clever one will be seen from the following extract:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the fascinating numbers of 'Trilby,' as they appeared in
<i>Harper's Magazine</i>, I read with delight of one Joe Sibley, idle
apprentice, king of Bohemia, <i>roi des truands</i>, always in debt, vain,
witty, exquisite and original in art, eccentric in dress, genial,
caressing, scrupulously clean, sympathetic, charming; an irresistible
but unreliable friend, a jester of infinite humor, a man now
perched upon a pinnacle of fame (and notoriety), a worshipper of
himself; a white-haired, tall, slim, graceful person with pretty
manners and an unimpeachable moral tone. My only regret was
that too little was said about so charming a creation. I looked to
see more of him in the published three volumes. But no! I found
the addition of some thoughtful excursuses by Mr. du Maurier upon
nudity, agnosticism, and other more hazardous subjects, which
had, presumably, been judged too strong for the ice-watered, ice-<a name="page_018" id="page_018"></a>creamed constitution of the American Philistine; but I looked in
vain for the delightful Joseph Sibley. In his place I find a yellow-haired
Switzer, one Antony, son of a respectable burgher of Lausanne,
who is now tall, stout, strikingly handsome and rather
bald, but who in his youth had all the characteristics of the lost
Joseph Sibley&mdash;his idleness, his debts, his humor, his art, his
eccentricity, his charm. I rubbed my eye-glass. <i>Je me suis demandé
pourquoi.</i>"</p>

<p>Displeased with <i>The Speaker's</i> comments on his connection

print a letter from his solicitors, from which it appears that
the revised MS. of the novel was sent to him to be passed.
And apropos of this, he remarks in a letter to the editor:&mdash;"I

<h3>"Trilby" Entertainments</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Of entertainments</span> founded upon Mr. du Maurier's book,
the name is legion. The most pretentious, and at the same
time the most successful, was the series of "Scenes and
Songs from 'Trilby,'" given at Sherry's in the afternoon and
again in the evening of Saturday, February 9, for the benefit
of that admirable institution, the New York Kindergarten
Association. The affair, which had the advantage of distinguished
patronage, was given under the special management
of Mrs. Charles H. Ditson; Mr. E. Hamilton Bell arranged
the details of scenery and costume; and among those who
personated the various characters were several well-known
artists.</p>

<p>The audience was a large one, which was excellent for the
little ones who were to be benefited; and it was enthusiastic,
which was only a just and fit tribute to managers, performers
and singers. Every detail of the tableaux had been thought
out with infinite care, and posing, grouping and make-up
were as near perfection as du Maurier himself could have
wished. The program included the singing of "Ben Bolt,"
"Bonjour, Suzon," "Au Clair de la Lune" and several other
songs, and the following tableaux:&mdash;"The Three Musketeers
of the Brush"; "Wistful and Sweet"; "Svengali"; "I will
Not!"; "All As it Used to Be"; "Answer Me, Trilby!";
"The Soft Eyes"; "The Sweet Melodic Phrase";
"Dors, Ma Mignonne"; "The Nightingale's First Song";
"Malbrouck" and "It was Trilby." The entertainment
opened most effectively with a quartet by Messrs. Devoll,
Moore, Bracewell and Devoll. The first tableau, "Three
Musketeers of the Brush," received the admiration it deserved,
as did, also, the singing of Miss Akers and Mr. Mackenzie
Gordon interspersed with the different tableaux. The first
appearance of Trilby was awaited with impatient expectancy,
and when she came, she proved to be "wistful and sweet,"
indeed, in the person of Mrs. Eric Pape, the wife of the well-known
young artist. The last tableau of the second part,
"It was Trilby," was most effectively arranged by Mr. Pape.
The full cast of characters was as follows:&mdash;Trilby, Mrs. Eric
Pape; Taffy, W. Harris Roome; The Laird, Evert Jansen
Wendell; Little Billee, J. Gerald Benkard; Svengali, Robert
Reid; Gecko, Eric Pape; Dodor, William Abbott; Zouzou,
Franklin C. Butler; Mrs. Bagot, Mrs. J. Wells Champney;
Miss Bagot, Miss Lilian Wing; Mme. Malbrouck, Mme. Bettini;<a name="page_020" id="page_020"></a>
Durien, Leslie G. Cauldwell; Blanchisseuse, Miss Lou-lou
Noel; Fencer, Lieut. Gianni Bettini.</p>

<p>During the intermission between the first and second parts
of the program, Mrs. Kate Douglas Wiggin sold a copy of
"Trilby" presented by the Messrs. Harper. To this Mr.
du Maurier and Mr. Henry James (who persuaded the author
to write the book) had contributed their autographs, and Dr.
English a manuscript copy of his song "Ben Bolt." The
volume fetched $100, making the net addition to the Kindergarten
Association's treasury about $2500.</p>

<p class="asterisks">* * *</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At Mr. Mansfield's</span> Garrick Theatre, "Trilby" has been
burlesqued. It had already been parodied in book-form,
produced as a melodrama, read aloud in drawing-rooms, with
music, and put on the platform in "scenes and songs," so
that nothing was left to do with it but to make an "operatic
burlesque" of it; and this was duly accomplished by Messrs.
Joseph W. Herbert and Charles Puerner, the latter being
responsible for the music and the former for the words. The
piece is called "Thrilby." As in the serious play founded
upon the novel, the villain (rechristened "Spaghetti") is the
principal figure; and mesmerism is carried to a ridiculous
excess, even inanimate objects succumbing to its influence.
There is a farce within this farce; for "Mme. Sans-Gêne"
is parodied in a sub-play introduced under the name of
"Mme. Sans Ra-Gêne." The burlesque is by no means free
from horse-play, but it unquestionably accomplishes its purpose,
which is merely to amuse.</p>

<p>At the Casino, as well as at the Garrick, "Trilby" and
"Mme. Sans Gêne" have both been travestied.</p>

novel and decidedly interesting literary and musical entertainment
that was given on Oct. 17, at Omaha. It was
called 'An Evening with Trilby.' The participants were all
gentlemen. The subjects of the papers read were 'The
Story of Trilby,' 'Du Maurier, his Life and Work,' 'The
French of Trilby,' 'The Identity of the Artists in Trilby,'
'Trilby's Voice and Method,' 'Trilby as a Hypnotic Subject,'
'Could Trilby be Successfully Dramatized?' After
each paper there was Trilby music, which included 'Ben
Bolt,' 'Au Clair de la Lune,' 'Malbrouck s'en va-t-en Guerre'
and other songs and instrumental pieces. At the end of the
programme comes the inquiry, What shall we 'ave the pleasure

voice seems to have carried that distance without the least

made seven 'papers' about her without finding it necessary

of the most successful was given in May, at the house of
Postmaster Dayton, for the benefit of St. Luke's Home for
Indigent Christian Females. A literary criticism of the book
was read, and one of the chapters of the story; and the

was given under the auspices of the Daughters of the Revolution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">"Trilby's" wide popularity</span>&mdash;in the sense that many
people who are not, ordinarily, novel-readers take a lively interest
in it&mdash;is evidenced by many indications, not the least
significant being the concerts made up from the music mentioned
in the novel. One such was given in San Francisco
last December, under the management of the ladies of the
Mercantile Library Auxiliary and for the benefit of the
Library's unfortunately slender exchequer. According to <i>The
Argonaut</i>, a very interesting program was presented, including
Schubert's "Rosamonde," Adam's "Cantique de Noël,"
Chopin's Impromptu in A flat, "Bonjour Suzon," "Le Capitaine
Roquefinette" and the much-discussed "Ben Bolt."</p>

<h3>Miscellanea</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. du Maurier</span> and Mr. James took a walk together,
one day, and the artist unfolded to the novelist the plot of
"Trilby," suggesting that he should use it in a novel. Mr.
James persuaded him to write the story himself. He did so;
and what has been the result? Think of the time and skill,
the money and material that have been employed in putting
the thing in type, preparing its illustrations, printing it as a
serial and reprinting it in book-form; in dramatizing it, burlesquing
it in books and on the stage, in adapting its songs
and illustrations for reproduction on lecture-platforms and in
drawing-rooms, and in translating and publishing Nodier's
tale, from which the author took his title! Its presentation
has given employment, onerous or enjoyable, honorary or
remunerative, to thousands; hundreds of thousands have read
it, and hundreds of thousands seen it on the stage; and its
leading characters&mdash;Trilby, Svengali and "the three musketeers
of the brush"&mdash;have become household names and
personalities. It has enriched its author, added to the wealth
of its publishers, put money in the purses of playwright and
manager and replenished the treasuries of more than one excellent
charity. Directly or indirectly, no doubt, it has
caused much more than a million dollars to change hands
within the past eighteen months. And last but not least, it
is responsible for this pamphlet, in which is chronicled the
story of its rise and progress.</p>

<p class="asterisks">* * *</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At the</span> Mercantile Library, New York, it was found necessary,
at the time when "Trilby" was in greatest demand, to
circulate a hundred copies of the book; at the beginning of
June the number in circulation was seventy. Mr. Wingate
wrote to <i>The Critic</i> from Boston, in June, that there were six
copies of the book in the main building of the Public Library,
and one in each of its branches, but that this supply was inadequate,
72 demands for the book having come from the
branch libraries in a single day. And Mr. Hild writes to
us from Chicago that the Public Library of that city has 26
copies, but that they do not begin to supply the demand.
"I believe we could use 260 and never find a copy on the
shelves. Every one of our 54,000 card-holders seems determined
to read the book."<a name="page_023" id="page_023"></a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">On the point</span> of the morality or immorality of the book,
<i>The Independent</i> says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. du Maurier, apparently in deference to the current craze
for heroines that have been seduced, or are just going to be, bedaubs
the first fifty pages of his otherwise clean story with telling
how his pure heroine, Trilby, a <i>blanchisseuse de fin</i>, had been led
astray, and so forth. That is to say, he unnecessarily goes behind
the true door of his story to wash some dirty linen, and then
he sets forth."</p>

<p>On this point the San Francisco <i>Argonaut</i> does not agree
with its New York contemporary:&mdash;</p>

<p>"With those who think these passages immoral, we cannot
agree. Mr. du Maurier has treated with candor some facts belonging
to the realm of things which are usually understood instead of
being talked about; but he has done this with singular manliness
and delicacy, and with entire absence of mawkish or other improper
sentiment. The impression of Trilby's character left upon
the reader is entirely that of a noble, generous woman, whose
life is not a sin, but a tragedy."</p>

<p>The same paper reproduces "a letter Mr. du Maurier
wrote to a Paterson, N. J., man who contended that the relations
of Trilby with her hypnotizer were chaste, so far as
her consciousness of them went, and decided to find out if
he were right by writing to the novelist":&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Early in</span> March, 1895, one of the Boston clergymen advertised
Robert Grant's "Art of Living," as our Boston correspondent
reported at the time, and on Sunday, March 17,
another prominent minister took up "Trilby." So it is evident
that, even if Boston authorship is on the decline, as so
many New Yorkers enviously declare, the Boston clergy are
going to keep alive the interest in literary matters by emphatic
words to their congregations. "Have you read
'Trilby'?" was the theme of the Rev. George W. Bicknell's
sermon, and the topic crowded the church. The Reverend
Doctor declared that he had spent five hours reading the
book, and had decided that it was a story of magnificent possibilities,
but that its morality was "as one viewed it." He
considered the tale far-fetched and over-drawn and lacking
in healthful flavor, and placed it in the same class of art<a name="page_024" id="page_024"></a>
with the nude paintings at the World's Fair&mdash;a position to
which, we presume, the author would not object. Then he
launched out into an emphatic declaration that it was time
for the pulpit to speak out against art of this kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Du Maurier's</span> heroine has been heard of over in Brooklyn.
A married woman, aged twenty-nine, got into a dispute with
her husband, recently, as to the morals of the young model,
and proved her point by "smashing him over the head with
an earthenware jar." In the newspaper in which we read of
this intemperate act, the husband's age is not given, nor
the side he took in the argument, before he was shown to be
wrong. The fact that he got his head broken proves little&mdash;except
the folly of arguing with a woman; nor the additional
fact that he refused to appear against his wife in court.
But the case is one in which a good deal might be said on
both sides&mdash;if earthenware jars were not introduced too early
in the discussion.</p>

verse of "Drilby Re-versed," the former by Mary Kyle Dallas,
the latter by Leopold Jordan. In vulgarity and banality,
these two precious productions run each other a close race.

<p>A Broadway caterer now "molds his ice-cream in the
shape of a model of Trilby's ever-famous foot." Mr. du
Maurier can want no greater evidence of the popularity of
his story in America. That there is not a "Trilby" shoe on
the market reflects little credit upon the enterprise of our
bootmakers. It is an opportunity that no soap-maker would
neglect if it came his way. Possibly the fact that Trilby's
foot was large (as well as shapely) has something to do with
the shoemakers' backwardness. Hers were not Cinderella
slippers. ("The Lounger," 30 March, 1895.)</p>

<p>Mr. C. W. Coleman, Librarian of William and Mary College,
writes from Williamsburg, Va., to say that I am in error
in supposing that the bootmakers of this wide-wake country<a name="page_026" id="page_026"></a>
have not yet seized the name of du Maurier's heroine for
advertising purposes. In his note of correction he encloses
a clipping from the catalogue of a Chicago house, containing
a picture of a high-heeled ladies' shoe, flanked by an advertisement
of "'The Trilby,' price $3, postage 15 cts.&mdash;'an
ornament to any foot,'" etc. And I hear that the shop-windows
of Norfolk, Va., fairly bristle with shoes of this brand.
Moreover, a bootmaker's advertisement in the Pittsburg <i>Post</i>
shows (as a punning Pennsylvania correspondent writes to me)
that "Trilby has obtained a foothold even in the Iron City."
According to the advertisement, "this enterprising firm offer
to the lady sending in the most accurate dimensions according
to the diagram above, together with a drawn outline of the
nude foot on paper, a handsome pair of the highest grade
'Trilby' shoe, which they will have made up especially for
the winner. This stylish foot adornment for Pittsburgh's model
feet will be satin or silk lined throughout, of the finest quality
kid and best workmanship. Bear in mind, ladies, it need not
be the smallest feet that win, but the most perfect form of
a foot from a standpoint of proportionate measurements."

dear realization of the good in the girl's nature, which the
fine art of the author has been able to give to the reader.
The divine in the Laird, in Taffy and in Little Billee responded
to the divine in that undeveloped girl, and to them
the angel in her was the real Trilby in spite of all her past
experience. But idealism and realism in this charming story
are not quite happily balanced: the reader receives a blow
on the spiritual side of his being from the manifestation of
an agency in the universe that is endowed with an all-conquering
malevolence, something extraneous from the individual
and yet able to arrest in her the growth of the budding
germ of holiness and moral beauty, a power triumphant even
at the moment when her spirit was about to return to the

<p>If there yet remains a word to be said in criticism of this
book, it may, perhaps, be in regard to the musical part of it.
Whether intentionally or not, du Maurier has certainly
added an instance, which tends to prove the theory true, that
music in itself is neither elevating nor refining. Svengali is
drawn with inimitable skill, and with so much realism that
the reader feels that he must have been known and hated
by du Maurier in all his repulsiveness. And yet this loathsome
creature has the power of so seizing and expressing the
noblest works of the great masters of harmony as to move
his hearers to tears, to sway them at his will by the tenderness
and feeling he puts into the notes. It is a hard thing
for a music-lover to comprehend, that a man of low and
vicious life, and utterly without aspirations, can so express
the penetrating beauty that lies in music more than in any
other art. It shows, too, that music gives us only what it
finds in us, and proves the folly of "program music," or
music with a translation.</p>

does he call the most bourgeois piece of music he knows?</p>

<p>2. What was Svengali's real name?</p>

<p>3. Where does the author state that he is a social lion? Where
does he deny that he is a snob?</p>

<p>4. Where does he bring Little Billee in contact with Punch?</p>

<p>5. What did the Laird call M. le général Comte de la Tour-aux-Loups?</p>

<p>6. In what places does the author compare Gecko to a dog?</p>

<p>7. How old was Trilby when she died?</p>

<p>8. What was Little Billee's physical explanation of his inability
to love?</p>

<p>9. What verbal description of one of the heroes contradicts almost
every one of the author's drawings of him?</p>

<h3>The Songs in "Trilby"</h3>

<p>Dr. Thomas Dunn English wrote the words of "Ben
Bolt" in New York, in 1842, when he was a young man of
three-and-twenty. Mr. N. P. Willis had asked him to write
a sea-song for <i>The New Mirror</i>, and so he wound up the last
stanza with an allusion to "the salt-sea gale!" As a sea-song,
"Ben Bolt" is not a success; but it has been sung on every sea
and in every land where the English tongue is spoken. At
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1848, an English journalist named
Hunt quoted the words (from a defective memory) to Nelson
Kneass, who was attached to the local theatre; and, adapted
by Kneass to a German melody, the song, in a somewhat
garbled version, was introduced in a play called "The Battle
of Buena Vista." In Helen Kendrick Johnson's "Our
Familiar Songs, and Those Who Made Them" (Henry Holt
&amp; Co., 1881), the story of its vogue in England as well as in
America is told effectively. Not only were ships and steam-boats
named in its honor, but a play was built upon its suggestions,
and as recently as in 1877 an English novelist made the
memories evoked by the singing of the song a factor in the
development of his catastrophe. Its revival at the hand of
Mr. du Maurier is the latest and perhaps the most striking
tribute to its hold upon the popular heart. To the author
himself&mdash;in his ripe old age a member of the LIIId Congress&mdash;its
fame is seemingly a bore, for he is quoted as saying:&mdash;"I
am feeling very well and enjoying life as well as an old
man can, but this eternal 'Ben Bolt' business makes me so
infernally weary at times that existence becomes a burden.
The other night, at a meeting of a medical association at my
home in Newark, some one proposed that all hands join in
singing 'Ben Bolt,' whereupon I made a rush for the door,
and came very near forgetting the proprieties by straightway
leaving home. However, I recovered my equilibrium and rejoined
my friends. I don't think that General Sherman ever
grew half so tired of 'Marching Through Georgia' as I have
of that creation of mine, and it will be a blessed relief to me
when the public shall conclude to let it rest."</p>

<p>Apropos of the use made of the song in "Trilby," <i>Harper's
Bazar</i> published the words and music; whereupon the author
sent this letter to the editor:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is very pleasing to an old man like myself to have the literary
work of a half-century since dragged to light and commended,<a name="page_031" id="page_031"></a>
as has been the case with 'Ben Bolt' of late. I was flattered by
seeing my likeness&mdash;or, rather, the likeness of a younger man than
myself&mdash;in your pages; but I must protest against some errors
which, in spite of careful editing, enter into your transcription of
the song. The words of the original were:&mdash;</p>

<tr><td align="left"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the children went to swim?'</span></td></tr>

<p>"You have copied this, but in a better shape, with the exception
of changing the rhythm. I must protest against this change,
because the school-masters of between sixty and seventy years
since were, to my memory, 'cruel and grim'; they were neither
kind nor true. They seemed to think the only way to get learning
into a boy's head was by the use of the rod. There may have been
exceptions, but I never met them. At all events, 'what I have
written I have written.'"</p>

<p>In your columns of "Trilbyana" I have seen no mention
of the fact that George W. Cable, in his "Dr. Sevier"&mdash;a
thousand times better novel and better work, in every way,
than "Trilby,"&mdash;has introduced the old song "Ben Bolt"
with wonderful effect. It is strange that the old melody
should have appealed to the two men, so widely apart, and it
is but fair that the American's first, and most skilful, use of it
should have due recognition.</p>

<p>Mr. du Maurier was correct in saying that there is only
one verse of "Au Clair de la Lune"; yet there are possibly,
and probably, a thousand made in imitation of it, which go to
the same air. We quote from the San Francisco <i>Argonaut</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is to be observed that these <i>amateurs de Trilby</i> do not
go the length of singing 'Au Clair de la Lune,' even repeating
the first stanza twice, as Trilby did. But perhaps they
are as ignorant concerning the song as is Mr. du Maurier,
who declares there is but one verse. There are four. The
first is given in 'Trilby' thus:&mdash;</p>

<h3>A Search for Sources</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">To the Editors of The Critic</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>The liquid name, "Trilby," of du Maurier's heroine having
been duly run down to its source, will a slight excursus be
amiss as to the origin of the affectionate title applied by the
novelist on his charming little hero&mdash;"Little Billee"? Evidently
the name, together with certain descriptive touches,
has been taken from Thackeray's ballad, "Little Billee."
This racy skit, as many doubtless know, is in the best vein of
the great humorist's inimitable burlesque. It narrates the
tragic cruise of</p>

</table>

<p>Here, I say, we have the origin of the novelist's "Little
Billee," while, in the italicized phrases, we have also du
Maurier's, "the third, he was little Billee" (page 6), and
"he was young and tender, was little Billee."</p>

<p>It would be sheer nonsense, of course, to urge against the
famous novelist any charge of unacknowledged borrowing in
matters so entirely trivial. The point is merely a curious one
of origins; a little siccatine botanizing, so to speak, on the
<i>folia disjecta</i> that have been wonderfully spun by du Maurier's
genius into a fabric of grace and beauty so rare as is
this "Trilby." Nor, indeed, should the further fact be a detraction
from the gifted author of "Trilby," that his indebtedness
to Thackeray is obviously greater than in the
minutiæ under consideration&mdash;that, in fact, he has caught
from the great immortal the note of much that is best in his
book. In his limpid, graceful simplicity of words, and their
easy, natural flow&mdash;in his delicate, playful humor, and tender
but not overwrought pathos, we discover a careful study of<a name="page_036" id="page_036"></a>
found only a few general remarks about fairies, their habits
and habitations, nothing in the least resembling the story of
Jeannie's lover. Perhaps Nodier was mistaken about his
source. As he travelled in the Highlands, he may possibly
have "collected" the tale at first hand, and, there being no
folk-lore societies in those early days of romanticism, he was
not aware of the honor that thus accrued to him. It cannot
have evolved itself from a mere hint. We appeal to Mr.
Lang to take up and follow the chase farther. He might be
worse occupied than in tracing out the original John Trilby
MacFarlane, and whence he got his English-sounding name,
his fairy powers and his connection with Saint Columba&mdash;the
last probably from Nodier himself, who may have been
reading Montalembert's "Monks of the West" before setting
out upon his pilgrimage. Mr. Dole, by the way, irreverently
converts the Dove of the Churches into a "Saint Columbine,"
unknown to any respectable hagiographer. Think, Mr. Lang,
what a delightful coil this romancing Frenchman, let loose
among your Hielan' men, fairies, monks and Scotch novels,
has made for you to straighten out, and how many strange
discoveries may be made while you are about the job!</p>

<p>Miss Smith (2) has prepared another translation of Nodier's
story, and, though there is little choice between her version
and Mr. Dole's, we prefer it. It seems a trifle less exact, but
it is more idiomatic; and, if anything, she perhaps intensifies
the local color a little, which does not do the tale any harm.
Her book is got up in tartan cover; Mr. Dole's has a design

<h3>Nodier's "Trilby, le Lutin d'Argail"</h3>

<p>It was not long after the appearance of "Trilby" that
our readers detected the French origin of the name of Mr.
du Maurier's heroine. The story of the unearthing of this
delightful French fairy-tale may be followed in this series of
communications to <i>The Critic</i>:</p>

<p class="c">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>On looking over Roche's "Prosateurs Français," I find
that one of the "plus jolis" contes of Charles Nodier (1788-1844)
is entitled "Trilby"; therefore the title of du Maurier's
much-bought novel is not original with him. I should
be pleased if any reader of <i>The Critic</i> would inform me as
to the plot of Nodier's story.</p>

<p>In answer to the request of your correspondent in <i>The
Critic</i> of Nov. 17, I find the tale of "Trilby" in my copy of the
"Contes de Charles Nodier, illustrés par Tony Johannot."
"Trilby" is the story of a household fairy of Scotland (a
"Lutin familier de la Chaumière"). It is fantastic and
touching, but it has nothing in common with du Maurier's
"Trilby."</p>

<p>From the recent contributions to "Trilbyana" in your
columns, it would appear as if the name of Trilby (originally
Scotch or Irish?) were not uncommon in the writings of
French authors. Charles Nodier, in his <i>conte</i>, says that M.
de Latouche&mdash;a contemporary&mdash;wrote on the same subject,
"où cette charmante tradition était racontée en vers enchanteurs<a name="page_038" id="page_038"></a>"&mdash;which
gives one to suppose that "Trilby" was
the name of his enchantress; though, perhaps, he refers to
the old story of "Le Diable Amoureux." I find, moreover,
that Balzac takes the name for a type in his "Histoire des
Treize: Ferragus: Vol. I. Scènes de la Vie Parisienne"
(page 48 of edition of 1843):&mdash;"Pour développer cette histoire
dans toute la vérité de ses détails, pour en suivre le
cours dans toutes ses sinuosités, il faut ici divulguer quelques
secrets de l'amour, se glisser sous les lambris d'une chambre
à coucher, non pas effrontément, mais à la manière de Trilby
[the opposite to du Maurier's Trilby], n'effaroucher ni Dougal,
ni Jeannie, n'effaroucher personne," etc.</p>

<p class="c">(<i>Boston Evening Transcript, 1 Dec. 1894.</i>)</p>

<p>"The Listener was asked the other day where du Maurier
got the name of Trilby&mdash;a sweet and pleasant word, neither
English nor French, which seemed to suit so perfectly the
adorable young person of his creation. He was able to
answer, more by accident certainly than as the result of erudition,
that the name was not invented by du Maurier but
belongs to the French classics&mdash;possibly to Scottish folk-lore.
In the year 1822 there was first published in Paris a
<i>nouvelle</i>, by Charles Nodier, afterward a member of the
French Academy, entitled, "Trilby, or the Fay of Argyle";
it was a sort of fairy-story, in which a fay is in love with a
mortal woman, and the woman is very far from being indifferent
to his sentiment. This 'Trilby' attained a considerable
degree of popularity; it became, indeed, a French
classic; Sainte-Beuve has particularly praised the charm of
its style. * * * In his preface to the story, Nodier says:
'The subject of this story is derived from a preface or a
note to one of the romances of Sir Walter Scott, I do not
know which one.' This is a very indefinite acknowledgment
While Nodier may have got his subject from Scott,
the Listener doubts if he got the name 'Trilby' from him.
It is just the sort of name that a French writer would give
to a Scotch fay. Nevertheless, Trilby may be a real Scotch
elfin. The Listener would hardly claim personal acquaintance
with them all.</p>

<p>"Du Maurier's 'Trilby' is curiously prefigured, in part at
least, in Nodier's; and yet there is not the smallest thing
that the most jealous critic could call a plagiarism; it is a
legitimate parentage. As you go on with Nodier's story,
you love his Trilby more and more, as you do du Maurier's,
until you think that there was never so bewitching a fairy;<a name="page_039" id="page_039"></a>
and your love for Trilby is interwoven with your love for
Jeannie, his mortal sweetheart, just as your love for du
Manner's Trilby is forever mixed up with your tender sentiment
for Little Billee. You feel a sort of enchantment over
you like the hypnotism that you are under in du Maurier's
strange book. And both stories, while abounding in wit
and pretty things, are deeply tragical. It has been said of
Nodier's 'Trilby' that it belongs to the realm of the <i>supra-sensible</i>,
and so, in large measure, certainly does du Maurier's.
Du Maurier has confessed his obligation flatly in
giving his story the very name that Nodier's bore. It is conceivable
that the image of the Frenchman's haunting fairy
dwelt with him until he resolved to reincarnate the adorable
elf in the body of a girl as adorable. He gave his Trilby a
Scotch ancestry to connect her the more naturally with the
<i>lutin d'Argail</i>; and her fairy ancestry will easily account
not only for her early prankishness, but for her later unreality.
But it is a prefiguring merely, and not a direct suggestion.
Whatever du Maurier's 'Trilby' lacks, it isn't originality!"</p>

<p class="c">(<i>From Mr. C. E. L. Wingate's Boston Letter in The Critic of 20
April, 1893.</i>)</p>

<p>It appears that the first mention of the French book appeared
in <i>The Critic</i>, last November. It was in the same
month that Mr. Bradford Torrey * * * happened to
find a copy of Nodier's "Trilby" in the Boston Athenæum.
He took the book to his friend, Mr. J. E. Chamberlin of
<i>The Youth's Companion</i>, who began its translation at once.
A few days later appeared a note in <i>The Critic</i> from a correspondent
in Virginia. Thinking that secrecy was no longer
worth while, Mr. Chamberlin wrote his paragraphs for the
<i>Transcript</i> "Listener" column, incorporating a bit of translation.
This was printed on Dec. 1. Miss Minna C. Smith
went to Roberts Bros. at once, to ask them if they would consider
the publication of a translation of the romance by her
<i>Transcript</i> confrère, and Mr. F. Alcott Pratt replied that
they would like very much to see that gentleman's work.
Circumstances made Mr. Chamberlin decide not to finish the
translation, and he gave Miss Smith his idea and a few pages
of the manuscript for a Christmas present. During several
weeks following she was engaged upon her careful translation.
The Scotch words and names of localities in her
manuscript were corrected by Mr. J. Murray Kay of Houghton,
Mifflin &amp; Co., an accomplished Scot, who walked through
Argyle with his daughters last summer. On March 19, an<a name="page_040" id="page_040"></a>
article on Charles Nodier's story, foreshadowing Miss Smith's
translation, appeared in the <i>Transcript</i>. On the morning of
March 20, Mr. Dana Estes sent for Mr. Nathan Haskell
Dole and asked him to make a translation, which was done
with remarkable rapidity, and put out on March 29. Learning
of this, Lamson, Wolffe &amp; Co. hurried on Miss Smith's
book, which had been in the hands of their printer at the
Collins press for days, advertised it on Thursday and brought
it out on Saturday, in Scotch plaid covers.</p>

<p>This firm of Lamson, Wolffe &amp; Co., by the way, has just
been dissolved for a novel reason. Mr. Wolffe is a member
of the class of '95 at Harvard. The publication of "Trilby,
the Fairy of Argyle" called the attention of the faculty to his
publishing business, and he was asked to give it up, or else
forfeit his degree. He chose the former alternative, and
although the firm name will remain Lamson, Wolffe &amp; Co., a
new and, for the present, silent member of the firm has added
capital and scholarship to the house.</p>

<p>Nodier's "Trilby," who now revisits the book-stores
owing to Mr. du Maurier's having taken his name for his
heroine's, is one of the few latter-day fairies that have fairy
blood (or ichor) in their veins. He belongs on the same
shelf with Fouqué's "Undine," but, though he was only joking
when he personated a father who "had not seen him
since the days of King Fergus," he is certainly of the breed
of Una and Maer, Caoilte and Mananan. That he made a
sensation on his first appearance in the world of letters is
shown by Victor Hugo's ode, warning the Fairy of Argyle to
beware of ink-slinging penny-a-liners:&mdash;</p>

<p class="nind">advice which might be repeated apropos of Mr. du Maurier's
creation.</p>

<p>Mr. Dole, who has made a translation (1) of Nodier's
"Trilby," has looked through all of Scott's novels, he says,
to discover, if possible, the "preface or note" from which
the French author claimed to have drawn his story, and has<a name="page_041" id="page_041"></a>
the deft art of "Pendennis" and "The Newcomes." And
the "Cave of Harmony," with its songs and its bumpers and
long whiffs, the gay nights and rollicking days of F. B. and
Clive and Pendennis&mdash;the glamor of all which has enticed
full many a youngster towards the easy descent, or the shining
slopes (as the case may be) of art and letters&mdash;all these scenes
have doubtless served as the studies of the pictures, almost as
delightful and masterly as their prototypes, that du Maurier
gives us of the joyous Bohemian life of the three jolly Musketeers
of the Brush in the Quartier Latin in "Trilby."</p>

<p>As a small contribution to "Trilbyana," I would call attention
to the fact, unnoted so far, that Trilby was the name
of Eugénie de Guérin's pet dog, mentioned several times in
the journal she kept for her brother Maurice. Was the dog,
perhaps, named for the fairy?</p>

<p>As there seems to be a mania for hunting up the sources

game also. In Saintine's "Picciola," Book I., Chap XII.,
after the first paragraph, you will find the germ of "Peter
Ibbetson."</p>
